# CH375 to RS-232 Adapter

This adapter is designed to allow usb mass storage media to be accessible to a computer over standard RS232. As such it contains a CH375 to do the heavy lifting along with a MAX3232 rs-232 level shifter to drive full serial levels. An external regulated 5v source is required to power the device as well as any attached USB storage devices. This could be provided by a USB to barrel jack adapter with a cell phone charger, a stand alone switching wall supply, or possibly even by a ps/2 keyboard port tap that borrows some power from such a port.

This is still in the testing stage and has not yet been constructed, however the circuitry is heavilly based on the original datasheet examples so likely will work.
